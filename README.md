# I'M NOT CREATOR OF THIS MONACO WEB EDITOR!

## I'm only pushing this to Github because i want to easily create forks of these!


## 📁 What's inside?

- `/Monaco` – has text files like `globals.txt`, `classfunc.txt` etc. for auto-complete and intellisense stuff
- `/vs` – this is where the real monaco editor files are (base, editor, language stuff)
- `/tabs` – (custom tabs for gui maybe)
- `index.html` – you can open this in your browser to test the editor
- `README.md` – this file lol


## 🎨 Customization

this monaco build is hella modifiable:

- add your own globals in `/Monaco/*.txt`
- change syntax/language support in `/vs/basic-languages`
- hook it into your exploit ui by webview or other packages.


### End word

For 100% i will create more and better versions of AdvancedMonaco, because this one is broken (A bit problem with tabs)
